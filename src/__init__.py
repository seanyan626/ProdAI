# This file makes the 'src' directory a Python package.

# You can define a version for your source code package here, for example:
__version__ = "0.1.0"

# You might also choose to expose certain parts of your submodules directly,
# though this is often done within the submodules' __init__.py files themselves.
# Example (if you want to do `from src import agents` and then `agents.BaseAgent`):
# from . import agents
# from . import llms
# from . import memory
# from . import prompts
# from . import rag
# from . import tools
# from . import utils

# Or, if you want to expose specific classes/functions directly at the src level (less common for large projects):
# from .agents.base_agent import BaseAgent
# from .llms.base_llm import BaseLLM
